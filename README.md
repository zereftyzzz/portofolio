# Personal Portfolio

A web-based personal portfolio containing an abstract of projects I’ve built, thought process notes, design experimentation in animation and layout, and possibly a personal blog as it evolves.

This space is meant to explore visual presence, interaction, and structure — not just showcase finished work, but how I think and build.
